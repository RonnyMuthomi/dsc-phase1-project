# Aviation Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to determine the lowest-risk aircraft models for commercial and private enterprises. The analysis will provide actionable insights for the company's aviation division to guide their aircraft purchasing decisions.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder
The primary stakeholder is the head of the company's new aviation division, responsible for making data-driven decisions on aircraft acquisition.

### Key Business Questions
- Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?
- What are the common causes of aviation accidents?
- How do different aircraft manufacturers compare in terms of safety?
- What factors contribute most to aviation risk, and how can they be mitigated?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) covering incidents from 1962 to 2023.

### Description of Data
- **Accident Number**: Unique identifier for each incident.
- **Aircraft Model**: Type of aircraft involved.
- **Aircraft Manufacturer**: Company that produced the aircraft.
- **Event Date**: Date of the accident.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the incident.
- **Injury Severity**: Classification of accident severity.
- **Probable Cause**: Summary of the likely cause.
- **Weather Conditions**: Environmental factors during the event.
- **Phase of Flight**: Flight phase during which the incident occurred.

### Visualizations
1. **Aircraft Model vs. Number of Accidents** – A bar chart showing the most and least accident-prone aircraft models.
2. **Accident Causes by Category** – A pie chart breaking down the most common probable causes.
3. **Accident Trends Over Time** – A line graph displaying the trend of aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023.

## Conclusion
### Key Findings
1. **Aircraft Models with Lowest Risk** – Certain aircraft models exhibit significantly lower accident rates based on historical data.
2. **Common Accident Causes** – Pilot error and mechanical failure are the top contributors to aviation accidents.
3. **Safety Trends** – Over the years, aviation safety has improved, but certain aircraft types and manufacturers have higher risks than others.

These insights will assist the aviation division in making informed aircraft purchasing decisions, minimizing risks, and ensuring a safer fleet for operations.
